# Weather Dashboard

## This project was to create a weather dashboard using two APIs with OpenWeather. I used the Onecall API and the Geolocation API to gather location data that fed into the OpenWeather API. Previous Searches are clickable to see up to date data within each city.

- What was your motivation? Completing the project per the requirements given.
- Why did you build this project? I built this app to show my understanding of how to fetch API data and use it to generate tags/information on the index.
- What problem does it solve? This doesn't really solve any problems that a weather app hasn't already solved. This project is to show my understanding of using APIs.
- What did you learn? I learned how to use APIs to get data and store it to be used within another API.
